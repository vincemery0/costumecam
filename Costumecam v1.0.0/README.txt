         COSTUMECAM
         v1.0.0
------------------------------

HEYOO, thanks for checking out my project :)
I made this out of boredom, so I dont think I will update it anytime soon!

INSTRUCTIONS:
To open CostumeCam, use the included .html file (Costume.cam.html)
When opened and JavaScript enabled (usually enabled by default on browsers) the page should ask for your webcam permissions, make sure, that the browser 
has the right webcam set up. To check, go on for chrome: "chrome://settings/content/camera", for opera: "opera://settings/content/camera", for MS Edge: "edge://settings/privacy/sitePermissions/allPermissions/camera"
If so, give the site webcam-permission, and youre ready to go!
